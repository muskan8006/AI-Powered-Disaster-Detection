# CrisisVision â€” AI-Powered Disaster Detection

A multi-modal project that combines satellite-style image classification and social media text classification to detect and estimate disaster severity.

## How to run
1. Open CrisisVision.ipynb in Google Colab.
2. (Optional) Upload kaggle.json to use original Kaggle datasets.
3. Runtime -> Run all. Results, plots & models will be produced.

## What I used
- Image model: CNN trained on EuroSAT (satellite-image proxy)
- Text model: DistilBERT fine-tuned on tweet_eval sentiment (proxy for disaster urgency)
- Fusion: Simple example combining image + text confidences into a severity score

## Results
Please run the notebook and paste accuracy plots and confusion matricesÂ here.
